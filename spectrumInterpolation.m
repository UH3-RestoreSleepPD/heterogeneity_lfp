function newDat = spectrumInterpolation(data, Fs, Fl, neighborsToSample, neighborsToReplace)
%% This function interpolates around the frequency of interest (Fl) and replaces its and some neighbors using a constant value.
% Parameters: 
% data: column vector of the data that needs to be filtered
% Fs: sampling Frequency (in Hz) of the data
% Fl: Line frequency, typically 50 or 60 Hz. This frequency is the center
% of our interpolation.
% neighborsToSample: This parameter is in Hz, and tells this function how
% large of a window (in Hz) to use when picking the constant value to
% replace frequency content with.
% neighborsToReplace: This parameter is also in Hz, and tells this function
% which neighbors need to be replaced with the constant value that was
% determined by neighborsToSample. Generally, neighborsToReplace <
% neighborsToSample in order to get a better spectral estimate.
